This plugin will scan your Wordpress site in order to check if there are settings and configurations with your web server, PHP or with wordpress that could leave your website vulnerable to hackers. 

== Description ==

The thread of hackers is becoming a bigger concern every day. As tools get smarter and faster, it has become much easier for websites to get hacked. Often the hack can be performed by an automated tool if it discovers that your site has some pretty simple vulnerabilities. Quite often people don't know of these security back doors or may have overlooked something that seems insignificant, but can actually be a back door into your system. 

This plugin will perform a scan of your Wordpress site along with the settings and configurations available to the underlying code to check for any vulnerabilities in your webserver. If an issue is detected the plugin will advise you the best course of action to take in order to resolve the issue.
